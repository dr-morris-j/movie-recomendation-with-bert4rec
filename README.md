# movie-recomendation-with-bert4rec

### About the model.

This project is coded for the transformer-based model, Bert4Rec. Bert4Rec is similar to Bert for NLP because both are transformer-based. This one differs since it is a transformer network targeted at predicting "hidden", "masked", or `new`, movies based on a user's history. In the notebook, `list_movies` represents the user's watch history.

The edition of the model in this notebook is untrained, inaccurate, and hilarious.
