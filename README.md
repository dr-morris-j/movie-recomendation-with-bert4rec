# movie-recomendation-with-bert4rec

### About the model.
This project is coded for the transformer-based model, Bert4Rec. Bert4Rec is similar to Bert for NLP because both are transformer-based. This one differs since it is a transformer network targeted at predicting "hidden", "masked", or `new`, movies from a user's history.

The edition in this notebook is untrained and, consequently, inaccurate, and hilarious.

The complete dataset is available [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/).
